### **Slide 1: Title Slide**  
**Title:** Problems with Current Transformation & Liquidity Automation Architecture  

---

### **Slide 2: Overview of Current Architecture**  
- **Transformation Service** processes payloads from multiple source systems.  
- Some **source systems perform transformations themselves**, others rely on the **Transformation Service**.  
- Transformation Service **calls Liq Automation at the end** to update liquidity.  
- **No standardization** across source systems, leading to **inconsistencies**.  

---

### **Slide 3: Key Problems in the Current Architecture**  
ðŸš¨ **1. Lack of Standardization Across Source Systems**  
- Some systems handle transformations themselves, others depend on the service.  
- **Inconsistent data formats** create processing challenges.  
- **Difficult to onboard new source systems** due to varying logic.  

ðŸš¨ **2. Redundant Processing & Inefficiencies**  
- Some source systems **duplicate transformation logic** before calling the service.  
- Transformation **always calls Liq Automation**, even when unnecessary.  
- Results in **increased latency** & **unnecessary API calls**.  

ðŸš¨ **3. No Retry Mechanism in Transformation Service**  
- If transformation fails, **there is no retry logic**, leading to **data loss**.  
- **Network failures** while calling Liq Automation result in complete transaction failures.  
- **No Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)** for tracking failed transactions.

### **Slide 4: Liquidity Update & Partial Processing Issues**  
ðŸš¨ **4. Inconsistent Liquidity Updates & Partial Failures**  
- Transformation Service **calls Liq Automation at the last step**.  
- If Liq Automation fails, **partial transactions** occur, leading to **data integrity issues**.  
- No rollback mechanism in case of failures.  

ðŸš¨ **5. Schema Evolution & Compatibility Issues**  
- No **common schema standard** across source systems.  
- Different systems send **different payload structures**, leading to transformation failures.  
- **No schema versioning** to ensure backward compatibility.  

---

### **Slide 5: Scalability & Monitoring Challenges**  
ðŸš¨ **6. Scalability Issues Due to Synchronous Processing**  
- Entire workflow is **synchronous**, causing delays during high loads.  
- Cannot efficiently handle **bulk deal updates**.  
- Leads to **timeouts and slow processing**.  

ðŸš¨ **7. Lack of Observability & Debugging Complexity**  
- No **tracing mechanism** to track failures across transformation & Liq Automation.  
- Debugging is difficult due to **limited logging and monitoring**.  
- No centralized logging across services.

### **Slide 6: Summary of Key Issues**  
âœ… **Standardization needed** to unify transformation logic across source systems.  
âœ… **Event-driven architecture required** to decouple transformation & Liq Automation.  
âœ… **Retries & error handling must be implemented** to avoid data loss.  
âœ… **Schema registry & versioning necessary** to handle data format inconsistencies.  
âœ… **Scalability improvements required** to handle high-volume transactions.  
âœ… **Observability & monitoring enhancements** to improve debugging and logging.
