Analytical Expertise (Advanced):
I have consistently demonstrated advanced analytical skills, particularly during the AWS FSx ONTAP migration. This required deep problem-solving across multiprotocol access, LDAP, NTFS, and networking, where I resolved blockers independently in an area new to the LOB. My ability to quickly analyze complex issues, design solutions, and verify end-to-end flows reflects strong analytical capability.

Clear Communication (Proficient):
I have communicated effectively with AWS support and team members, providing regular updates, documenting solutions, and ensuring knowledge transfer. While I have been clear and collaborative, I see scope to further enhance stakeholder-level communication by presenting technical outcomes in more concise, business-oriented terms.

Coaching and Development (Proficient):
Through documentation and knowledge sharing, I helped teammates understand FSx concepts and PDN Data Service migrations, reducing future dependencies. I am progressing well in this area but can focus more on proactive mentoring and knowledge transfer to build stronger collective expertise.

Collaborative Teamwork (Advanced):
I have consistently worked closely with peers such as Sourav and Yeswanth to align on requirements, testing, and design decisions. I also collaborated effectively with AWS support to resolve critical FSx issues. My ability to build trust, share knowledge, and contribute toward team goals reflects advanced collaboration and a strong team-first approach.

Functional Knowledge (Proficient):
I developed strong understanding of PDN services by migrating APIs from Proxy to Data Services and performing end-to-end testing. I also contributed to the PDN Checker cloud version through component parsing logic. While proficient, I aim to further deepen my functional expertise to become a go-to person in the domain.

Impactful Innovation (Developing):
I introduced improvements such as automatic termination of older Job Scheduler versions to ensure smooth scaling. While this reflects innovative thinking, I recognize there is more scope to proactively bring in new ideas and explore modern practices (e.g., integrating AI tools like MCP servers) to strengthen this competency further.

Strategic Execution (Advanced):
I have shown strong execution in high-stakes initiatives like the FSx ONTAP migration and Job Scheduler enhancements, ensuring alignment with long-term goals and reducing operational risks. My ability to plan, collaborate, and drive end-to-end ownership in new areas demonstrates advanced capability in strategic execution.
