Over the past half-year, I have demonstrated strong ownership, technical depth, and collaborative execution across multiple high-impact projects:

IBM DataPower Migration Service
Successfully delivered the DataPower migration service using Java Spring Boot. This involved deep collaboration with the Delta and DataPower teams to handle numerous edge cases. I contributed by rewriting and enhancing over 3,000 lines of code and scripts, ensuring end-to-end functionality. I also resolved a long-standing production issue in CBOA and ensured successful testing of all 7 supported deal types.

Workflow Engine Revamp
Co-developed a new workflow engine from scratch alongside Shaurya and Sudhakara, replacing the legacy jBPM system. This significantly reduced system complexity and improved maintainability.

TDR-UI Migration
Led the upgrade of the TDR-UI from Angular v5 to v19, involving more than 100 file-level changes. I addressed numerous compatibility issues and handled complex UI logic to ensure a smooth migration.

Workflow JUnit Coverage
Took initiative to drive unit test coverage, contributing ~80% JUnit test coverage for the workflow module in just one and a half sprints.

Workflow Automation Setup
Set up test automation for the workflow system and completed 2 out of 5 critical flows within 1.5 sprints, setting the stage for scalable QA processes.

UI Slowness Investigation
Conducted an in-depth performance analysis of the UI and identified core reasons for slowness, including potential fixes and refactor opportunities.

Architectural Design Contributions
After gaining a holistic understanding of the system, I proposed key components and architectural design changes to improve overall scalability and performance.

Innovation Initiative â€“ Deep Learning on Logs
Proposed a novel idea to apply deep learning to application logs using graph databases to model relationships and detect anomalies or issues more intelligently.


//////
Throughout the first half of the year, I have consistently aligned my work with Wells Fargo's core values and expectations:

Customer Focus & Accountability:
Delivered mission-critical components like the IBM DataPower migration service and the redesigned workflow engine with high accuracy and stability, directly improving internal customer experience and system reliability.

Collaboration & Inclusion:
Worked closely with cross-functional teams such as Delta, DataPower, UI, and QA teams. I actively listened to diverse viewpoints and contributed toward shared goals, ensuring every stakeholder was aligned.

Integrity & Responsibility:
Took full ownership of production issues in CBOA and existing workflows, ensuring resolution with transparency and urgency. I stayed accountable to timelines and maintained high-quality standards in all deliverables.

Leadership & Innovation:
Took initiative in redesigning critical architecture components and driving JUnit and automation coverage for the new workflow. I also proposed a deep learning-based innovation to enhance system observability using graph-based log relationships.

Continuous Improvement:
Identified and analyzed UI performance bottlenecks and suggested actionable technical improvements to enhance usability and system speed. This reflects my ongoing commitment to improving our systems and user experience.
